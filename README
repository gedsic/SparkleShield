The Sparkle Shield is an add-on shield for Arduino that has 70 individually
programmable full color LEDs arranged in a 7x10 matrix. It comes as an
unassembled kit that you can solder yourself with a few basic tools.  The
Sparkle Shield comes with a bunch of cool animations, but it's also easy to
program your own using the free Arduino development kit (compatible with
PC/Mac/Linux) and the Sparkle Shield Arduino library.
